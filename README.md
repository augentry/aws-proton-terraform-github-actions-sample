## Terraform OpenSource GitHub Actions automation template for AWS Proton TEST

Welcome! This repository should help you test how Proton works with Terraform Open Source to provision your infrastructure. In this repository you will find three things:

1. A CloudFormation template (GitHubConfiguration.yaml) that will help you get the underlying roles and permissions set up
2. A GitHub Actions task to run Terraform Open Source based on commits to this repo
3. An AWS Proton sample template that uses Terraform files to work

## How to:

You will need the following:
- `ENVIRONMENT_NAME`: the name of the environment you plan to create
- `REGION`: the region into which you will be deploying this service
- `TEMPLATE_BUCKET`: An S3 bucket in which you can store your Proton templates
- `GITHUB_USER`: A GitHub account with which you can fork this repository

1. Fork this repository into your GitHub account
1. Ensure you have a CodeStar Connection set up for the account into which you
   forked the repo in the previous step. For information on how to set that up see [this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/connections-create.html).
3. Run GitHubConfiguration.yaml through CloudFormation (https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). This will create a role that GitHub Actions will use to provision resources into your account, as well as an S3 bucket to store Terraform Open Source state files. Make sure you use all lowercase names in the stack name, as we will use it to create an S3 bucket to save your state files.
```
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name aws-proton-terraform-role-stack \
   --template-body file:///$PWD/GitHubConfiguration.yaml \
   --parameters ParameterKey=FullRepoName,ParameterValue=GITHUB_USER/aws-proton-terraform-github-actions-sample \
   --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```
4. Open the file `env_config.json`. Add a new object to the configuration dictionary where the key is `ENVIRONMENT_NAME`, `role` is the `Role` output from the stack created in (3), and the region with `REGION`. This will tell Terraform the role and region to use for deployments. You can use different roles for each environment by adding them to this file
5. Open the file `.github/workflows/terraform.yml` and update `bucket` used for the `terraform init` command with the `BucketName` output from (3). This will tell Terraform where to store the state file
6. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
7. Take the sample template and create a Proton environment template by following the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/template-create.html). Make sure to replace `TEMPLATE_BUCKET` with the name of the bucket in which you would like to store your Proton templates.
```
tar -zcvf sample-vpc-environment-template.tar.gz sample-templates/sample-vpc-environment-template/
aws s3 cp sample-vpc-environment-template.tar.gz s3://TEMPLATE_BUCKET/sample-vpc-environment-template.tar.gz --region REGION
rm sample-vpc-environment-template.tar.gz

aws proton create-environment-template --name "sample-vpc-environment-template"
aws proton create-environment-template-version \
        --template-name sample-vpc-environment-template \
        --description "Sample template for setting up a Pull Request environment" \
        --source s3="{bucket=TEMPLATE_BUCKET, key=sample-vpc-environment-template.tar.gz}"
        --region REGION
aws proton update-environment-template-version \
        --template-name "sample-vpc-environment-template" \
        --major-version "1" \
        --minor-version "0" \
        --status "PUBLISHED"
        --region REGION
```
7. Register your repository with Proton by following the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/ag-create-repo.html) 
8. Deploy your environment in Proton by following the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/ag-create-env.html#ag-create-env-pull-request). Change `GITHUB_USER` to be name of the GitHub account with the forked repository.
```
 aws proton create-environment \
        --name "pr-environment" \
        --template-name "sample-vpc-environment-template" \
        --template-major-version "1" \
        --provisioning-repository="branch=main,name=GITHUB_USER/aws-proton-terraform-github-actions-sample,provider=GITHUB"
        --spec file:///$PWD/example_schema.txt
```
9. Shortly after you trigger the deployment, come back to your repository to see the Pull Request. Once you merge it, you can go back to Proton and see the updated status of your newly created environment
